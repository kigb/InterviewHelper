#### Translated question: Write a program that flips a list

### Generating answer...

#### Answer:

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a **code** and **algorithm** for response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Write a program that flips a list

### Response: Sure, here is some code and an algorithm for you.

#### Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty list `flipped_list` to store the flipped version of the input list `lst`.
2. Iterate over the input list `lst` from the end to the beginning.
3. Append each element to the `flipped_list`.
4. Return the `flipped_list`.

#### Implementation



```python3
class Solution:
   def flipLst(self, lst: List[int]) -> List[int]:
       flipped_list = []
       for i in range(len(lst) - 1, -1, -1):
           flipped_list.append(lst[i])
       return flipped_list
```


#### Complexity Analysis

Here, $n$ is the length of the input list `lst`.

* Time complexity: $O(n)$

 We iterate over the input list `lst` from the end to the beginning, which takes $O(n)$ time.

* Space complexity: $O(n)$

 We need to store the flipped list `flipped_list`, which takes $O(n)$ space.
